# Rectal swabs as an alternative sample collection method to bulk stool for the real-time PCR detection of *Giardia duodenalis* 

**Project goals:**
* To develop a protocol for DNA isolation from rectal swabs for qPCR detection of enteric parasites.
* To validate this protocol by comparing the validity and reproducibility of qPCR diagnosis of *Giardia duodenalis* by DNA isolated from paired rectal swab and bulk stool samples collected in rural Boboye Department, Dosso Region, Niger.
